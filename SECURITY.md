# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in `dfts-helper`, `dfts-qrcode`, `dfx-helper`, `dfx-qrcode`, `dfx-bootstrap-table` or `dfx-bootstrap-icons` (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can reach us at <security@dafnik.me>.

You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but likely within a few days.

## Scope

We only fix vulnerability in the code distributed through our main source code repository on GitHub. Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that installation and not us.
